    <center><b><ul>Whats new in Zealotry 0.7.4</ul></b></br></center>
    <b>XPI</b> - Zealotry is now a full fledged XPI! This allows us 
              to constantly work on new updates without having to 
              go through Skotos in order to test and add new features.</br>
    <b>Backgrounds</b> - You can now select what background you want to 
              see behind the text. This can be found in the options
              menu. Any backgrounds that you use will be saved 
              for easy picking if you decide to change.</br>
    <b>Fixed Font Size</b> - You are now able to select what fixed font
              size you wish to use. </br>
    <b>Dictionary Lookup</b> - In the options menu you'll find an option
              to lookup a word. This services opens a small popup with
              the definition that is provided by dictionary.net.</br>
    <b>Hot Keys</b> - All the menu options are now hot keyed for 
              convenience.</br>
    <b>Tab Completion</b> - If you enter the first letter or two, tab 
              completion will attempt to find a match in your history 
              of previously entered commands. It will cycle through 
              all available matches as long as you keep pressing tab.</br>
    <b>Scrollback Buffer</b> - We've added a secondary scrollback 
              buffer. This scrollback buffer will open a collapsed frame 
              that will allow you to go through scrollback while also 
              letting you see any new activity. <i>This option is 
              disabled by default. You MUST enable it in the options 
              menu if you want to use it!</i> To use this option after 
              you enable it, press Page Up. To close the frame, press 
              Page Down until you reach the end of your scrollback.</br>
    <b>Help Menu</b> - I'm sure you're aware of the help menu. You 
              are, after all, reading this file. The help menu will 
              contain help.</br>
    <b>Zelly</b> - Zelly is our mascot. See him above? Zelly was created 
              by Age. If you like him, tell her.</br>
    <b>Bug Fixes</b> - A bunch of bugs have been fixed from version 0.6.
